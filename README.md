# GPA Calculator

A web application that calculates your GPA using a backend API to fetch the necessary data. This repository contains both the frontend and backend code to run the application.

## Overview

This project is designed to calculate a student's GPA (Grade Point Average) based on the grades they input. The application consists of two main parts:

- Frontend: A simple Angular UI where users input their course grades and receive their GPA.
- Backend: A Spring Boot / Spring Web API that processes the grades and computes the GPA based on predefined logic.
